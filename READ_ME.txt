This program allows the user to try different rotations, scaling factors, filters and images. To experiment simply change the variables at the beginning of the “Top” script. From here the program will execute all sub functions. The Scale Factor and Rotation variables define an array of values. Add or remove values here in order to output different results. Note, these 2 arrays must be the same length. The filter selection also needs to be the same length and ranges from 0 – 2 as detailed below;0 –  No Filter1 –  Mean Average Filter2 – Median FilterBy default the filter window length is set to 25, to change this go to MAFilter.m and change the value for the variable a.The picture selection is controlled by the number in imageSelec(x), choose a number from 1-2 to experiment with different pictures. The image selection choice is as follows;1 – Surrey2 – Checkered Pattern
